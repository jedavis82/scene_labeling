# scene_labeling
This codebase contains the implementation of the Scene To Text system that incorporates spatial relationship information developed as PhD dissertation research in CITE PHD. 

This code is free to use but the authors ask that if you make use of any of the code during research you cite the work using PAPER CITATION. 

# Installation 
## Anaconda Environment
The codebase makes use of an Anaconda enviroment. This environment can be installed by running the following command from the conda_env directory in an Anaconda prompt: 

`conda env create -f environment.yml` 

## MatLab Engine for Python
The Histogram of Forces (HOF) code is used to compute the spatial relationships between object two tuples in an image. 

The HOF code is implemented in MatLab and the MatLab engine for Python is required to run the HOF code. 

Installation instructions for the MatLab engine for Python can be found at this [link](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html).  

You will need to follow the instructions for intalling the engine API at the system command prompt and this will need to be done inside of the Anaconda environment. 

For example, from an Anaconda prompt, run the following commands: 

`conda activate scene_labeling`

`cd <matlabroot>\extern\engines\python`

`python setup.py install`
## YOLOv3 Object Detection Model 
The code base uses the YOLOv3 object detection model. Due to size constraints on the repository, this model could not be uploaded. The model can be downloaded from the [YOLOv3 site](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/). 

The files required are: 
- yolov3.cfg
- yolov3.weights

The code base originally stored these files in the input/models/ directory, as can be seen in the object_detection.py script. 

# Usage 
The first script to execute is the `import_coco.py` script. This script will download the specified number of images
from the COCO 17 data set. These images will be saved in the coco_images/ directory. This repository contains example 
output for each of the three stages of the pipeline as ran on 25 sample images. These files are: 

- input/object_detection.csv
- input/person_object_detection.csv
- input/metadata.csv
- output/level_one_summaries.csv
- output/general_level_two_summaries.csv
- output/person_level_two_summaries.csv

After the images are downloaded, the `app.py` script can be ran and will process each of the input images using the 
three stages of the pipeline. 

1. Object detection
   1. Performs object localization using the YOLOv3 [[1]](#1) model 
   2. Performs meta data generation using the Inception model 
      1. The Inception model will be downloaded at runtime to the appropriate directory if the model does not exist
   3. The object localization and meta data results will be stored in CSV files
2. Level One Summaries
   1. Generates information corresponding to proximity, overlap, and spatial relationships pertaining to each object two-tuple in an image
   2. Promity and Overlap information is computed using the Generalized Intersection Over Union (GIOU) [[5]](#5) algorithm
   3. Spatial Relationship information is computed using the Histogram of Forces (HOF) [[2]](#2) [[3]](#3) [[4]](#4) algorithm
   4. The level one summaries will be stored to CSV file after computation 
   5. This is a computationally expensive process, and as such there is a boolean flag in `app.py`
      1. `FINALIZED_LEVEL_ONE` is set to false initially for level one summary computation 
         1. Level one summaries will be written to disk every 10 computations to avoid recomputing results
         2. `FINALIZED_LEVEL_ONE` should be set to true after the level one summaries have been computed
3. Level Two Summaries
   1. In the general case, level two summaries indicate if two objects are or are not interacting 
      1. The general level two summaries are stored in a CSV file after computation
   2. The person domain level two summaries indicate interactions between a person and an object in the scene
      1. These level two summaries are stored to disk after computation

# Visualization 
The scripts located in the visualizations/ directory can be used to visualize each of the system outputs generated.

# Example System Output 
Below are some example outputs generated by the S2T system. Each table contains the localization results on the right 
with the **General** domain level two summaries and **Person** domain level two summaries on the right. 

| Object Localization | Level Two Summaries | 
| ------------------- | ------------------- | 
| ![](./bench.jpg)    | **General:** Person_1 interacting with bench_1 <br /> **Person:** Person_1 sitting on bench_1 | 
| ![](./umbrella.jpg) | **General:** Person_1 interacting with umbrella_1 <br /> **Person:** Person_1 carrying umbrella_1 | 
| ![](./cell_phone.jpg)| **General:** Person_1 interacting with cell_phone_1 <br /> **Person:** person_1 talking on cell_phone_1 |
